This NoSQL project utilizes MongoDB as the database to store and manage large volumes of flight data, including historical flight information and weather data. 
The project focuses on building flight delay prediction models using various machine learning techniques, such as regression, decision trees. 
The models will be trained on historical data and updated with real-time data to improve accuracy. 
The ultimate goal of the project is to provide airlines and passengers with more accurate and timely information about flight delays.

We applied the CRISP-DM framework to predict flight delays. We started with the Business Understanding phase, where we identified the problem and defined the project goal. ![image](https://github.com/Bimsarasmp/Flight-Delay-Prediction-/assets/139919035/e2112e27-b714-4f5d-a01f-55ee426c661f)

Next, in the Data Understanding phase, we gathered and explored historical flight data and weather information. 
Then, we moved to the Data Preparation phase, where we cleaned, transformed, and prepared the data for modeling. 
The Modeling phase involved building and testing several machine learning models to predict flight delays.
We then evaluated the performance of the different models in the Evaluation phase and selected the best one. 
Finally, in the Deployment phase, we will implement the model and integrate it into the airline's operations to help prevent and minimize the impact of flight delays .
